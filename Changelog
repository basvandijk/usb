1.3

	* Add hotplug support.

        * Add the System.USB.IO.Transfers module which separates the
	construction from the execution of a USB transfer. This has the
	advantage that a transfer can be constructed once and executed
	multiple times thereby saving repeated allocation costs.

	* Added the deviceSpeed, portNumber, portNumbers and parent functions to
	System.USB.Enumeration.

	* Added the setAutoDetachKernelDriver to System.USB.DeviceHandling.

	* Added the System.USB.Misc module which exports
	the hasCapability & libusbVersion functions.

	* Extended the Verbosity type with the PrintDebug constructor.

1.2.0.1 (Fri May 23 21:50:20 UTC 2014)

	* Drop UnicodeSyntax and the dependency on base-unicode-symbols.

	* Fix build on GHC-7.8.2.


1.2 (Mon Nov 26 22:55:48 UTC 2012)

	* Make retrieving the DeviceDesc and ConfigDescs IO operations.

	* Use Vectors instead of lists in the public API.

	* Export pokeVector from System.USB.Internal.

	* Fix build & warnings on Windows.

	* Performance improvements.

	* Documentation improvements.


1.1.0.4 (Wed Nov 21 23:29:54 UTC 2012)

	* Use Foreign.Concurrent.newForeignPtr on Windows
	This will hopefully resolve #1
	This solution was also suggested by Maurício C. Antunes:
	https://bitbucket.org/mauricio/bindings-dsl/issue/11/fix-the-calling-convention-for-funptrs-to

	* Update documentation.


1.1.0.3 (Sat Sep 8 00:48:55 UTC 2012)

	* Derive Generic instances for all data types.

	* Support base-4.6 and bytestring-0.10.

	* Fix build on Windows.

	* Use the new labeled URLs in Haddock.

	* Updated copyright dates.


1.1.0.2 (Sat May 5 23:47:44 UTC 2012)

	* Lazily compute the list of digits from decodeBCD.

	* Support containers-0.5.


1.1.0.1 (Thu Apr 12 21:21:14 UTC 2012)

	* Prevent a potential space-leak.


1.1 (Sat Jan 7 20:54:10 UTC 2012)

	* Support base-4.5

	* Mark the safe modules as Trustworthy and the unsafe ones as Unsafe.

	* Replaced getEvtMgr with getWait


1.0 (Mon Sep 12 19:50:37 UTC 2011)

	* Support for isochronous reads and writes.

	* All I/O functions now use the libusb asynchronous interface when
	support for the GHC event manager is available.
	This should be more efficient and allows cancelling of an in flight
	transfer by throwing an exception to the thread performing the transfer.

	* Added writeControlExact :: DeviceHandle -> ControlAction WriteExactAction.

	* All I/O functions which previously returned the boolean TimedOut
	now return a: data Status = Completed | TimedOut.

	* Added the timeout constant: noTimeout :: Timeout.

	* Added function: maxIsoPacketSize :: EndpointDesc -> Size
	Which calculates the maximum packet size which a specific endpoint
	is capable of sending or receiving in the duration of 1 microframe.
	This function is mainly useful for setting up isochronous transfers.

	* Added some specific IOExceptions:
	ioException :: USBException
	incompleteReadException :: USBException
	incompleteWriteException :: USBException

	* Renamed System.USB.IO.Synchronous to just System.USB.IO.

	* Renamed System.USB.Unsafe to System.USB.Internal and exported more
	functions from it which are primarily needed in the usb-iteratee
	package.

	* Fixed some bugs.


0.8 (Wed Mar 9 12:21:51 UTC 2011)

	* getStrDesc and getStrDescFirstLang now return a Text instead of a
	String I believe this is a more efficient and cleaner interface.


0.7 (Mon Jan 17 22:04:29 UTC 2011)

	* Change type of setConfig to allow setting a device in unconfigured state
	-setConfig :: DeviceHandle ->       ConfigValue -> IO ()
	+setConfig :: DeviceHandle -> Maybe ConfigValue -> IO ()

	* Changed type of getConfig to match setConfig
	-getConfig :: DeviceHandle -> IO ConfigValue
	+getConfig :: DeviceHandle -> IO (Maybe ConfigValue)

	* Added setConfig and getConfig functions to System.USB.IO.StandardDeviceRequests.
	These functions are for testing purposes only!


0.6.0.8 (Thu Jan 13 12:29:15 UTC 2011)

	* Fix bug in getDevices:
	c'libusb_free_device_list returns a 64bit number on 64bit platforms
	getDevices assumed c'libusb_free_device_list returned a CInt.
	This is correct on 32bit platforms but on 64bit platforms it returns an Int64.
	To fix it, I generalized checkUSBException to work over any Integral type.


0.6.0.7 (Tue Jan 4 12:30:43 UTC 2011)

	* Fixed bug in getDevices:
	c'libusb_free_device_list returned undocumented error code

	* Show unknown libusb error code in unknownLibUsbError


0.6.0.6 (Sun Dec 26 12:00:30 UTC 2010)

	* Import missing (>>) in Utils (only when ghc < 7)
	Reported by Joris Putcuyps.


0.6.0.5 (Thu Dec 16 16:20:12 UTC 2010)

	* Support text-0.11.

	* Resolved some warning when compiling with ghc-7


0.6.0.4 (Sat Oct 23 00:15:14 UTC 2010)

	* Support text-0.10.


0.6.0.3 (Thu Oct 21 21:37:50 UTC 2010)

	* Tested with GHC-7 and modified to work with base-4.3.


0.6.0.2 (Wed Oct 6 22:06:43 UTC 2010)

	* Support text-0.9.


0.6.0.1 (Mon Sep 13 05:48:41 UTC 2010)

	* Fixed bug in Utf16LE encoding in getStrDesc.


0.6 (Sat Sep 11 14:19:36 UTC 2010)

	* Renamed BCD4 to ReleaseNumber.

	* Made StrIxs in descriptors optional.

	* Refactored handling of string descriptors (internal change).

	* Added strictness flags to all arguments of data constructors.


0.5.0.1 (Wed Sep 1 20:12:03 UTC 2010)

	* Support text-0.8

	* Prevent a potential space leak in the decoding of BCD values
	(Binary Coded Decimals)


0.5 (Mon Jul 26 05:48:59 UTC 2010)

	* Fixed bug in all writing related functions: writeControl, writeBulk
	and writeInterrupt.  I erroneously ignored the offset in the given
	ByteString.

	* Fixed bug in getDevices Don't free the array when
	c'libusb_get_device_list returns c'LIBUSB_ERROR_NO_MEM.

	* Fixed bug in 'setStandardTestMode' Wrong conversion from TestMode to
	Word16.

	* Specify the length of the requested string in getStrDesc in characters
	instead of bytes.

	* Moved the standard device requests to their own module
	System.USB.IO.StandardDeviceRequests

	* Added System.USB.Unsafe This module is needed by the usb-enumerator
	package.

	* Added convenience function 'readControlExact' which is similar to
	'readControl' but checks if the specified number of bytes to read were
	actually read. Throws an 'IOException' if this is not the case.

	* Defined more instances for various types.  Most types have now
	instances for: Show, Read, Eq, Data and Typeable

	* Added type TimedOut = Bool

	* Some refactoring and documentation


0.4 (Wed Jun 16 09:12:22 UTC 2010)

	* Some reordering and naming of arguments:
	< type ReadAction = Timeout → Size → IO (B.ByteString, Bool)
	> type ReadAction = Size → Timeout → IO (B.ByteString, Bool)

	< type WriteAction = Timeout → B.ByteString → IO (Size, Bool)
	> type WriteAction = B.ByteString → Timeout → IO (Size, Bool)

	* Return the iterator when the enumerator reads 0 bytes

	* Restricted the enumerators to work on Word8 instead of a polymorphic
	elements This is to prevent readFromPtr to read outside allocated memory

	* Use the package MonadCatchIO-transformers-foreign in
	System.USB.IO.Synchronous.Enumerator


0.3.1 (Sun May 2 20:23:24 UTC 2010)

	* Made the descriptor types non-abstract

	* Updated dependencies
	iteratee                  >= 0.3.5 && < 0.4
	transformers              >= 0.2   && < 0.3
	MonadCatchIO-transformers >= 0.2   && < 0.3

	* Always include the Enumerator and remove its flag


0.3.0.1 (Wed Dec 23 13:41:49 UTC 2009)

	* Tested with base-4.2

	* Tested with text-0.7


0.3 (Tue Dec 8 21:06:22 UTC 2009)

	* Moved the enumeration of usb devices in its own module:
	System.USB.Enumeration

	* Moved the device descriptor inside the device type so that you can
	retrieve it without doing IO, e.g: deviceDesc :: Device -> DeviceDesc

	* Moved the configuration descriptors inside the device descriptor so
	you can retrieve them without doing IO, e.g: deviceConfigs :: DeviceDesc
	-> [ConfigDesc]

	* Implemented standard device requests that are missing from libusb.

	* Made the timeout of I/O operations explicit. Now all I/O operations
	return an additional Bool that indicates if the operation has timed
	out. If an operation timed out does not mean there is no result, it just
	means that the result may be incomplete.

	* Added experimental (and still untested) support for iteratees for
	doing predictable, high-performance, safe, and elegant input processing
	using the iteratee package. See module:
	System.USB.IO.Synchronous.Enumerator

	* Fixed some asynchronous exception related bugs (put a needed bracket,
	block and unblock here and there).

	* Finally some functions, constructors and types got renamed,
	documentation got updated and extended and some refactoring has taken
	place.
